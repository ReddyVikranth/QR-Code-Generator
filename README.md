# QR-Code-Generator
This is a python QR code Generator. By using this code, you convert any of your data(url,string,number) into a QR code, that can be scanned by using your mobile scanner itself.

Currently this project is in progress and I am so confused for making it. If anyone is glancing at my code and want to contribute or want to give any suggesions, please let me know. Thank you.
